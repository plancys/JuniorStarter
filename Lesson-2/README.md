In the log section you should see: ```2017-04-15 19:47:47.230  INFO 19462 --- [           main] pl.server.DemoApplication                : Started DemoApplication in 3.774 seconds (JVM running for 4.196)```
## 4. Check whether server works
Open web broweser and type address (address of our server): ```localhost:8080```. If you see this (screen below) it means that server works!
