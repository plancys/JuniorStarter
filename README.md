## Course approach
My approach to learning is somehow different that typical path. I prefer to start with exercises and then go to theory. I hope some of you also like this way of learning.

## Esential technologies (my subjective choice)
1. **JAVA** - programming language
2. **Intellij IDEA** - IDE  
3. **MAVEN** - build tool 
4. **Spring BOOT** - Rest/Dependency Injection/(..) framework
5. **GIT** - Version Control

## Path
[Lesson 1 - Setup environment](https://github.com/plancys/JuniorStarter/blob/master/Lesson-001/README.md)

[Lesson 2 - (Upcomming) Running a server ](https://github.com/plancys/JuniorStarter/blob/master/Lesson-001/README.md)
